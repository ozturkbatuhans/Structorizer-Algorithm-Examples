# Structorizer-Algorithm-Examples

This repository contains a few algorithm visualizations created using Structorizer. The files are in .nsd format and represent structured flowcharts for learning and practicing algorithm logic.

# Contents

     – A visual implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

      I created this example to learn how the Bubble Sort method works and to practice using arrays in algorithm design.

     – An example of a search algorithm

     – A small practice exercise focused on basic algorithmic structure

# About Me

I'm a student currently learning the fundamentals of programming and algorithms. These diagrams were made as part of my learning process to better understand core concepts like loops, conditions, and array handling. Structorizer helps me visualize algorithm flow and logic in a structured and beginner-friendly way.
